"""Smoke test for the MCP server entry point.

Regression test for PR #85 (deadlock fix). Spawns ``vibe-trading-mcp`` as a
subprocess and walks through the full JSON-RPC happy path:

1. ``initialize`` handshake.
2. ``tools/list`` returns the registered tool catalogue.
3. ``tools/call`` for ``analyze_options`` (a network-free Black-Scholes
   calculation) returns a sane numeric result.

The combined run cost is one cold spawn (~3-5s) plus sub-second per request.
The most important assertion is that ``tools/call`` does not hang: without
the registry pre-warm in ``mcp_server.main()``, the lazy registry build runs
inside FastMCP's worker thread on the first ``tools/call`` and deadlocks.
